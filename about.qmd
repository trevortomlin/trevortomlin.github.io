Hi, I'm Trevor. I am a motivated and passionate student with a strong interest in computer science and technology. I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at the University of Washington Tacoma. I enjoy exploring new technologies and topics in all branches of computer science including machine learning and cryptography. Recently I have been researching privacy preserving machine learning techniques such as federated learning, differential privacy, and homomorphic encryption. I am excited to continue learning and growing in my field, and I am eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to innovative and impactful projects.
