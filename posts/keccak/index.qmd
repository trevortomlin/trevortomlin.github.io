Cryptographic algorithms such as Keccak play a crucial role in securing sensitive information, but they can often seem daunting and complex to understand. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standard for Keccak, in particular, has become a widely used cryptographic algorithm due to its high security and efficiency. However, the technical jargon and complex mathematical concepts surrounding Keccak can be intimidating for those unfamiliar with the field of cryptography. In this blog post, I aim to provide a comprehensive yet accessible guide to the NIST standard for Keccak, breaking down the technical terms and explaining them in an easier to understand way.

## What is the NIST standard for Keccak?

The NIST standard for Keccak is a set of specifications for the Keccak cryptographic algorithm developed by Guido Bertoni, Joan Daemen, Michaël Peeters, and Gilles Van Assche. The NIST standard, officially known as [FIPS 202](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.202.pdf), was published in 2015 as a part of a competition that NIST organized. Keccak is a family of hash functions, with different versions that provide varying levels of security and performance. The NIST standard specifies the requirements for the use of Keccak in a variety of applications, including digital signatures, key derivation, and password hashing.

## Parameter Specifications

Keccak is described in the format `Keccak-p[b,n]` where b is the rate + capacity and n is the number of rounds. Additionally, the parameter $w$ is defined as $\frac{b}{25}$ and $l$ is $log_2(w)$. `Keccak-f[b]` is a subset of `Keccak-p[b,n]` where $n$ is fixed to $12 + 2l$. 

| b | 25 | 50 | 100 | 200 | 400 | 800 | 1600 |
|---|----|----|-----|-----| ----|-----|------|
| w | 1  | 2  |  4  |  8  | 16  | 32  | 64   |
| l | 0  | 1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  | 6    |

**In this blog we are using `Keccak-f[1600]` which is the SHA-3 standard.** This means that the rate is 576, the capacity is 1024, and the output length is 512. $w$ is 64 and $l$ is 6.

## Input
Keccak recieves a strings of bits stored in **little-endian** format. Keccak pads the end of the input with the byte `0x06` followed by as many `0x00` bytes as necessary to make the input a multiple of the rate of the hash function. The last byte of the last block is set to `0x80`.

## Understanding SHA-3's Hash Function

The state of the hash function is represented as a 5x5 matrix of 64-bit words. The state is initialized to all zeros. The input is then XORed with the state. The state is then passed through the Keccak-p permutation function. This process is repeated until all of the input has been processed. The output is the state of the hash function.

To convert from a bit string to the state array we use the following function:
```java
private static long[][] stringToStateArray(String s) {
    long[][] A = new long[5][5];
    int i = 0;

    for (int y = 0; y < 5; y++) {
        for (int x = 0; x < 5; x++) {
            String blockString = s.substring(i * 64, (i + 1) * 64);
            A[x][y] = Long.reverse(Long.parseUnsignedLong(blockString, 2));
            i++;
            // 9 is the number of longs to store 576 (rate) / 64 (size of long) = 9 longs
            if (i>=8) {
                return A;
            }
        }
    }

    return A;
}
```
More information about this can be found in section 3.1.2 of FIPS 202.

The 5-step mappings in the Keccak cryptographic algorithm are the core components that transform input data into a fixed-length hash output. 

Some of the step mappings require this function, which rotates the bits of a 64-bit integer to the left by a specified number of bits:
```java
private static long rotateLeft(long x, int n) {
    return (x << n) | (x >>> (64 - n));
}
```

* Theta: In this step, the input data is transformed by applying a linear function to each row of the state matrix. This step helps to increase the security of the algorithm by increasing the diffusion of the input data.

![Figure 3 From FIPS 202](theta.png)

```java
public static long[][] theta(long[][] A) {
    long[] C = new long[5];
    for (int x = 0; x < 5; x++) {
        C[x] = A[x][0] ^ A[x][1] ^ A[x][2] ^ A[x][3] ^ A[x][4];
    }

    long[] D = new long[5];
    for (int x = 0; x < 5; x++) {
        D[x] = (C[(x+4)%5]) ^ rotateLeft(C[(x+1)%5], 1);
    }

    for (int x = 0; x < 5; x++) {
        for (int y = 0; y < 5; y++) {
            A[x][y] ^= D[x];
        }
    }
    return A;
}
```

* Rho: The state matrix is rotated by a certain number of positions in this step. The amount of rotation is determined by a pre-defined pattern, which varies depending on the version of Keccak being used.

![Figure 4 From FIPS 202](rho.png)

* Pi: In this step, the columns and rows of the state matrix are rearranged according to a pre-defined permutation. This helps to further increase the diffusion of the input data.

![Figure 5 From FIPS 202](pi.png)

* Chi: The state matrix is transformed by applying a non-linear function to each row. This helps to introduce non-linearity into the algorithm and make it more resistant to attacks.

In practice, the Pi and Rho steps are combined into a single step mapping. The combined step mapping is defined as:
```java
public static long[][] pi_rho(long[][] A) {

    final int[][] offsets = new int[][] {
        {0, 1, 62, 28, 27},
        {36, 44, 6, 55, 20},
        {3, 10, 43, 25, 39},
        {41, 45, 15, 21, 8},
        {18, 2, 61, 56, 14}
    };

    long[][] B = new long[5][5];
    for (int y = 0; y < 5; y++) {
        for (int x = 0; x < 5; x++) {
            int newX = 2 * x + 3 * y;
            newX %= 5;
            int newY = y;

            long rotatedValue = rotateLeft(A[x][y], offsets[y][x]);

            B[newY][newX] = rotatedValue;
        }
    }

    return B;

}
```

![Figure 6 From FIPS 202](chi.png)

```java
public static long[][] chi(long[][] A) {
    long[][] C = new long[5][5];
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
            C[i][j] = A[i][j] ^ ((~A[(i+1)%5][j]) & A[(i+2)%5][j]);
        }
    }
    return C;
}
```

* Iota: The final step involves XORing a pre-defined round constant with a specific location in the state matrix. This helps to add additional randomness to the output and increase the security of the algorithm.

```java
public static long[][] iota(long[][] A, int round) {
    long RC = rc[round];
    A[0][0] ^= RC;
    return A;
}
```

In this case the round constants are retrieved from a lookup table, however the round constants can also be calculated using Algorithm 5 from the NIST standard.
Below is the lookup table for the round constants:
```java
private static final long[] rc = {
    0x0000000000000001L,
    0x0000000000008082L,
    0x800000000000808AL,
    0x8000000080008000L,
    0x000000000000808BL,
    0x0000000080000001L,
    0x8000000080008081L,
    0x8000000000008009L,
    0x000000000000008AL,
    0x0000000000000088L,
    0x0000000080008009L,
    0x000000008000000AL,
    0x000000008000808BL,
    0x800000000000008BL,
    0x8000000000008089L,
    0x8000000000008003L,
    0x8000000000008002L,
    0x8000000000000080L,
    0x000000000000800AL,
    0x800000008000000AL,
    0x8000000080008081L,
    0x8000000000008080L,
    0x0000000080000001L,
    0x8000000080008008L
};
```

By repeating these 5-step mappings multiple times, the input data is progressively transformed into a fixed-length hash output. The number of rounds performed depends on the version of Keccak being used and the desired level of security. The output produced by Keccak is considered to be highly secure and is resistant to various attacks such as collision, preimage, and second preimage attacks.

A single round is defined as:
```java
public static long[][] keccakRound(long[][] A, int round) {
    A = theta(A);
    A = pi_rho(A);
    A = chi(A);
    A = iota(A, round);
    return A;
}
```

And gets repeated for the number of rounds:
```java
public static long[][] keccakf(long[][] A, int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        A = keccakRound(A, i);
    }
    return A;
}
```

To put this all together, here is psuedo code for the Keccak algorithm:
```
function keccak-f(A)
    for i from 0 to 24
        A = θ(A)
        A = π(A)
        A = ρ(A)
        A = χ(A)
        A = ι(A, i)
    return A

function SHA-3(M)
    P = M || 0x06 || 0x00 || … || 0x80 so that len(P) * constant == rate
    n = len(P)/rate
    c = list of blocks with a length of rate bits

    Initialize all state values to 0

    for i from 0 to n-1
        S = S xor c[i]
        S = keccak_round(S)

    Z = empty string
    for i from 0 to n-1
        Z = Z || S[i*b..(i+1)*b-1]
    return Z
```
